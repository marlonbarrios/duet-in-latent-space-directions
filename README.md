Provide a brief description of what your app does and what it's used for. Include any general information that might help new users understand the purpose of the app and its functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you meet the following requirements:
- **Node.js**: Required to run npm commands. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js, but you can check if it's installed by running `npm -v` in your terminal.
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Recommended editor for this project. Download it from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### VS Code Extensions:
  - **GitHub Copilot**: For AI-powered code assistance.
  - **Prettier**: To automatically format your code. 

Install these from the Extensions view in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) by searching for their names and clicking install.

## Installation

To set up your local development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
git clone https://your-repository-link.git
cd your-project-directory



2. **Install dependencies**:
npm install



3. **Run the application**:
npm run dev



This command starts the server on `http://localhost:3000` or another configured port.

## Usage

Here, explain how to use the application, include information on any scripts that might be necessary for building or deploying the app, and any special configuration details for interacting with `fal.ai` or other external APIs.

## Additional Information

If your app connects with `fal.ai`, ensure that API keys or other secure elements are not hard-coded in the source code. Use environment variables or a secure vault service for storing sensitive information.
